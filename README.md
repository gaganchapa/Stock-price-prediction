# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This Python program utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a powerful machine learning technique, to predict the prices of selected stocks.

## Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices using historical data. It employs the following libraries:
- `pandas_datareader` for fetching stock data
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `seaborn` for enhancing plot aesthetics
- `scikit-learn` for data preprocessing
- `keras` for building the LSTM model

## Getting Started

To run this code, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas-datareader numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn keras
